Issues mentioend include: column headers, multiple variables in one column, variables in rows and columns, multiple observational units in the same table, and single obervational unit stored in multiple tables. Table 4 is messy because there is too much happening in the chart and is difficult to read because of the categories. Melting a dataset is turning columns into rows.\n",

Table 11 is messy because there are many gaps within the chart and also does not organize the dates well while Table 12 is more specific when organizing the dates in the molten data the elements column contains names of variables. Tidy data fixes the issues with the columns an dhas numbers that represent the variables and numbers given.\n",

How should future large scale surveys be adjusted to best reflect the diversity of the population?
